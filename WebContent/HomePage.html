<h2>Development</h2>
<p>I developed a project named Human Resource Management system in Java during my btech last semester. In this project, I worked as Java developer and developed the system with my team.
After that during my thesis in Mtech,I did a project about Natural Language Interfaces to Databases. I developed a system using Java, Unix and Sql. The system was designed to satisfy the need of entering queries in their natural language.
I also published my thesis work on internet. Currently, I am doing Java Bootcamp in Grand Circus. I am alot about Java and other stuff. I did Midterm project in Java.
The project is to develop a Restaurant Menu and pricing. This is a console application. So, these are the projects I worked on.  </p>
